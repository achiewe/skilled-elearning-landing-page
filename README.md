### Links
- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

In this project I learnt about working with a mobile first workflow and using media queries to allow for a responsive landing page on mobile, tablet and desktop. I also developed my understanding of CSS grid and flexbox to manipulate elements on the page.

### Continued development

I still need to continue to develop a more efficient mobile first workflow, as well an an understanding of margin and padding to avoid elements moving around the page and causing unintentional behaviours.
